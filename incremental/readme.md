# ðŸ“Š Incremental Evaluation Suite

This directory contains evaluation scripts for analyzing performance in **continual learning** scenarios with a focus on temporal data shifts.

## ðŸ§ª Evaluation Methods

The following methods are implemented and used for assessing the quality and stability of learned visual representations over time:

### ðŸ”¹ `ncm.py`

- Standard **Nearest Class Mean (NCM)** classifier.

### ðŸ”¹ `ncm_v2.py`

- Implements **NCM-TI** (Time-Invariant NCM) as described in the paper.

### ðŸ”¹ `fecam_v3.py`

- Implements the **FeCAM** method used in the paper.

### ðŸ”¹ `fecam_common_v3.py`

- Variant of FeCAM that shares a **common covariance matrix** across all classes.

### ðŸ”¹ `ranpac.py`

- Implements the **RANPAC** method used in the paper.

### ðŸ”¹ `randumb.py`

- Implements the **RANDUMB** method used in the paper.
